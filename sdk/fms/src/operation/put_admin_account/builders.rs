Only the organization's management account can create an Firewall Manager administrator account. When you create an Firewall Manager administrator account, the service checks to see if the account is already a delegated administrator within Organizations. If the account isn't a delegated administrator, Firewall Manager calls Organizations to delegate the account within Organizations.
